# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Status

This is currently an empty repository with no initialized project structure. When working in this repository:

1. **Project Initialization**: If asked to create a new project, always ask the user for:
   - The desired technology stack (e.g., Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java)
   - The project type (web app, CLI tool, library, etc.)
   - Any specific frameworks or tools they want to use

2. **No Existing Structure**: There are no existing conventions, build commands, or test frameworks to follow. Any new code should establish clear patterns for future development.

## Commands

No build, test, or development commands are currently defined. These will need to be established based on the technology stack chosen for the project.
